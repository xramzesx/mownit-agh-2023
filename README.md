# Metody Obliczeniowe w Nauce i Technice (MOWNiT)

## Overview

Also known as Numerical Methods. The main aim of this course was to introduce students to tools used in technical and scientific computations, such as algorithms and libraries. All reports and homework assignments were written in Polish.
